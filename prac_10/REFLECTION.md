# Estimate:
Regarding the estimates for each of the practical, it took me at least 2 days for each of the prac. This is one of the subjects which im very weak at and my accuracy was really poor at the start but as the subject progressed I learnt from my mistakes and tried to reflect for each of the practicals. I would say personally ive improved a bit.

# Code Reviews:
Doing code reviews was a little challenging for me as codes might come out perfect, but ill have to study the code thoroughly to ensure that my feedback makes sense to the person. But each review was an opportunity to increase the quality of work and learn more about the different ways in which the program works

# Practical tasks:
I'm happy with how each practical tasks have been implemented with accurate instruction on what to do, but I might add some collaborative exercises which allows us to interact with our fellow students more.
